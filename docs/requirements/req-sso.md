# Single Sign-On (SSO) Authentication Requirement

## Overview

Implement a streamlined authentication system using Single Sign-On (SSO) with multiple popular identity providers. This will allow users to securely access the application using their existing accounts from major providers without the need for a separate username and password.

## User Story

As a user,
I want to sign in to the application using my existing Google or Facebook account
So that I can access the application securely without creating and managing another set of credentials

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Users must be able to authenticate using any of these SSO providers:

   - Google
   - Facebook

2. Login Flow

   - Clear SSO provider options should be displayed on the login page
   - Each provider should have its distinct button with recognizable branding
   - Users should be redirected to the chosen provider's authentication page
   - After successful authentication:
     - System checks if user has a completed user profile
     - If profile is incomplete:
       1. User is redirected to the user profile form
       2. After profile completion, user is redirected to their last URL before the login page
     - If profile is complete:
       1. User is directly redirected to their last URL before the login page

3. Session Management

   - Users should remain logged in until they explicitly log out
   - Session timeout should be implemented for security
   - Users should be able to log out from any page in the application

4. User Profile

   - Basic profile information should be fetched from the SSO provider:
     - Name
     - Email
     - Slug : used for URL to identify the user
     - Postcodes (optional): List of postcode related to user, e.g.: residential, work, school, and others..
     - Avatar (optional): URL of a selected image from a set of predefined images.
   - Email addresses must be verified by the provider

5. Error Handling
   - Clear error messages should be displayed if SSO fails
   - Users should be able to retry or choose a different provider
   - Application should handle network connectivity issues gracefully

## Additional Notes

- No custom authentication system should be implemented
- Must comply with each provider's branding guidelines
- Must implement proper security measures for token handling
- Need to support both mobile and desktop browsers
- Should follow accessibility guidelines for authentication interfaces
